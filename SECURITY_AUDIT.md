## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Input Validation**: Both frontend and backend validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
3. **CORS Protection**: Restricts cross-origin requests
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposure
5. **Environment Security**: Secure defaults and documentation
6. **Content Security**: Sanitized user inputs
7. **HTTPS Ready**: Production-ready SSL configuration

## 🧾 Evidence (how to verify)

Below are minimal commands and notes you can run to reproduce or verify key checks from this audit. Replace `yourdomain.com` and other placeholders as applicable.

- Check response headers (HSTS, CSP, cookies):

```bash
curl -sI https://yourdomain.com | egrep -i "strict-transport-security|content-security-policy|set-cookie"
```

- Show npm audit summary (local install):

```bash
npm audit --json | jq '{vulnerabilities: .vulnerabilities, metadata: .metadata}'
```

- Quick rate-limit test (observe blocked responses after repeats):

Use a simple looped curl script targeting the contact endpoint and watch for 429 responses.

- CSP report endpoint (if enabled):

Check your server logs or the configured report-uri for incoming CSP violation reports after enabling report-only mode.

Add actual clipped outputs or links to CI artifacts here to increase confidence.

## 🔧 Remaining recommendations (recommended edits)

These are low-risk, high-value items to add to the report or implement in the project before final production rollout.

- Content Security Policy (CSP) — add a starter policy and deploy as report-only first. Example (adjust for analytics/external CDNs):

```text
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://www.google-analytics.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint
```

- HSTS — enforce long-lived HSTS once HTTPS is confirmed. Example header:

```text
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

- Secure cookies — ensure session cookies use HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite flags.

- CI security checks — integrate `npm audit`, Dependabot or Snyk into CI and fail builds on critical issues.

- Secrets management — add a short note recommending a secret manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GitHub Secrets) and confirm `.env` is not committed.

- Logging & monitoring — recommend integrating error aggregation (Sentry) and observability (Prometheus/Datadog) and define retention/backup plans for logs.

- Backups & DR — add a MongoDB backup cadence and test-restore instructions; include retention policy.

- Rate limit tuning — add details on how rate limits are tested (IPs vs user accounts) and consider CAPTCHA for contact forms under heavy load.

- Add a short "Scope & Confidence" paragraph noting assumptions (tests were run against local/staging; not all external integrations checked) and the confidence level.
