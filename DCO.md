# Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or

2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

3. The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not modified it.

4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## How to Sign Off

All commits must include a "Signed-off-by" line in the commit message. This can be done automatically by using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will add a line like:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

## For Web-based Commits

When making commits through GitHub's web interface (editing files directly on GitHub), the sign-off will be automatically added if the repository has the DCO requirement enabled.

## Why Sign Off?

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. It's similar to a warranty that you have the legal right to make the contribution.

This helps protect both contributors and the project from potential legal issues related to code contributions.
