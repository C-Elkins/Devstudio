## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/C-Elkins/devstudio-portfolio/security) in our repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the security advisory form with:
   - **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
   - **Steps to reproduce**: How to reproduce the issue
   - **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
   - **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for a fix

### 3. What to expect

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days
- **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

### 4. Scope

This security policy applies to:

- ✅ Main application code (frontend, backend, control center)
