This project previously used a server-side invite token system for admin access. As of September 2025, the invite system has been fully removed.

**Admin access is now protected by a secret path (e.g., `/admin-PORTFOLIO2025`) and standard login.**

All invite-related endpoints, models, and UI have been deleted for a simpler, more demo-friendly experience.

If you want me to add a demo script or a short walkthrough video snippet showing the invite flow end-to-end, I can add it to the repo.
